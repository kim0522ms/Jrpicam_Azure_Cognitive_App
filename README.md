# Jrpicam_Azure_Cognitive_App

This program extracts text from photos taken using Picamera of Raspberry pi and sends it to Server.

Before using this program, you need the Azure subscription and the Computer Vision API.
In addition, the extracted text data is sent in HTTP POST format, so Web Server to handle this is also required.
